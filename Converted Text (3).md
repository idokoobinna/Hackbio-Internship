**Introduction** 

The p53 protein, often referred to as the “guardian of the genome,” plays a crucial role in protecting the integrity of cellular DNA. Encoded by the **TP53 gene**, it is a tumor suppressor protein responsible for regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Mutations in p53 are associated with more than 50% of human cancers, making it one of the most studied proteins in oncology. P53 is a multi-domain protein essential for regulating cell cycle and apoptosis, consisting of several distinct regions:

**N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD)** - Responsible for interacting with transcriptional machinery.

**DNA-binding domain (DBD)**- Recognizes specific DNA sequences, crucial for its transcriptional activity.

**Tetramerization domain (TD)**- Enables p53 to form tetramers, essential for its biological function.

**C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD)** - Involved in modulating DNA-binding activity and interactions with other proteins.

**P53 function**

P53 is a tetramer that binds to DNA and activates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Its ability to sense and respond to DNA damage makes it a pivotal player in maintaining genomic stability. However, the protein is often mutated in cancer, with the majority of mutations located in its DNA-binding domain, disrupting its function and leading to unchecked cell proliferation.

**Evaluation of Homology Modeling and AlphaFold on p53 Protein.** 

Homology modeling is performed using templates from known structures of homologous proteins. Homology modeling relies on the availability of closely related template structures and works well for conserved regions, but it struggles with disordered or unique regions like those in p53. In contrast, AlphaFold3 can predict protein structures de novo, offering greater accuracy across both structured and disordered regions, even without a template. While homology modeling is effective when high-quality templates are available, AlphaFold3 is more versatile and generally produces more reliable models. For proteins with complex or flexible regions, such as p53, AlphaFold3 outperforms homology modeling in accuracy and applicability. AlphaFold3, due to its reliance on advanced machine learning techniques, predicts the entire structure of the p53 protein, including regions for which no structural data is available. It makes use of both evolutionary information and physical constraints to produce highly accurate models.

 PyMOL can be used to align predicted models from homology modeling and AlphaFold3 with experimental structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This alignment helps to visually and numerically assess the structural differences by generating RMSD scores. RMSD measures the average distance between the atoms (typically the backbone or Cα atoms) of the two aligned structures. A lower RMSD (typically less than 2 Å) indicates that the structures are very similar. A higher RMSD suggests significant conformational differences, which may reflect a transition between apo, agonist-bound, or antagonist-bound states.

The majority of p53 crystal structures deposited on the PDB have a ligand attachment. The crystal structure we modelled for p53 however is not bound to a ligand. The conformation predicted by the modelling programs is the apo form, because the lowest RMSD value 0.903 Å was produced by an apo crystal structure. The protein is in the inactive form.  The reference crystal structure for p53 (8UQS) was aligned individually with the Swiss model and AlphaFold3 p53 structures and generated an RMSD score of 0.903 Å across 115 atoms and 18.670 Å across 111 atoms, respectively. The low RMSD score from the Swiss model p53 protein and reference indicates high structural similarity. We can conclude from the alignment that the Swiss model is more accurate and represents a more similar conformation to the reference crystal structure (8UQS), in the apo form.
