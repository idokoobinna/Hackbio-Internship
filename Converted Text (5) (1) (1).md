**Track 1; drug discovery**

**Stage 0 ; Virtual screening**

 

The development of microbial products for cancer treatment has been in the spotlight in recent years. In order to accelerate the lengthy and expensive drug development process, in silico screening tools are systematically employed, especially during the initial discovery phase. Cancer is the umbrella name given to a group of diseases that manifest themselves similarly, namely by abnormal, uncontrolled cell division and growth (Gaspar P. et al. 2022).

According to the World Health Organization, the yearly number of deaths caused by cancer worldwide is approximately 10 million (who).

Recent drug discovery efforts have demonstrated that naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds like delphinidin have potential to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of breast cancer cells by targeting HER2 receptors (Patidar K. et al. 2016).

Virtual screening (VS) is a computational technique used in drug discovery to search libraries of small molecules in order to identify those structures which are most likely to bind to a drug target, typically a protein receptor or enzyme (Rester U. 2008)

 

**_Viral _Screening(VS) and Computational methods in Drug Repurposing__**

Repurposing a drug consists of two main steps, where the first is based on an in vitro screening of approved-drugs for clinical use or that have already been candidates in clinical trials. After screening, those with the best potential are validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The second step consists of an evaluation of the most promising candidate in clinical trials, and thus highlighting the potential of the drug (Gns,H.S.; Gr, S. 2019).

 In terms of in silico approaches, several screening methods have been developed and applied for drug repurposing, such as machine learning (ML), molecular docking, network-based, and other virtual approaches.(Orlov, A.A.;et al 2019).

 The utilization of virtual screening greatly optimizes the discovery process, in comparison with experimental strategies. The computational method reduces the discovery time due to the possibility of performing an initial screening in large chemical libraries containing millions of compounds \[83]. In this context, compounds databases such as DrugBank, ChemBank, Protein Data Bank, and others are typically used in this step. (Gns,H.S.; Gr, S.et al 2019).

 

The databases used in virtual screenings for drug repurposing contain information related to drug interactions; genes; targets; rare diseases; orphan drugs; clinical trials; pathways and diseases; adverse effects; toxicity profile; reused drugs; the 3D-molecular structure of drugs. In this context, the database selection is a critical step for success in the drug repurposing, since an updated database and a validated screening procedure increase the success rate.(Serçinoğlu, O; et al 2019)

 

The virtual screening (VS) approach can be applied based on the structure of a target, or based on the structure of the ligand. Indeed, molecular docking becomes the most used alternative in structure-based VS (SBVS) in drug repurposing, so that it has the ability to investigate the potential mechanism of action, applying scoring functions to categorize and rank all the compounds \[105]. Besides, molecular dynamics (MD) studies began to be integrated into VS campaigns to improve screening performance, in order to take into account the flexibility of the target protein (native conformation), improving the evaluation of VS ligands, or even calculate the most accurate binding energy of them.(Belllera, C.L. et.al 2019)
