Stage 0 ; Virtual screening

Introduction

Viral infections pose risks in patients with cancer, both due to the potential forviral reactivation or exacerbation related to receipt of cancer therapy and due

to long-term consequences of harboring the virus in cancer survivors. A recentmultisite screening study from the SWOG Cancer Research Network found thata substantial number of patients with newly diagnosed cancer with viral

infections, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), wereunaware of their viral status prior to presentation to

oncology clinics);(Ramsey SD,et.al 2019).

The development of microbial products for cancer treatment has been in the

spotlight in recent years. In order to accelerate the lengthy and expensive drugdevelopment process, in silico screening tools are systematically employed,

especially during the initial discovery phase. Cancer is the umbrella name givento a group of diseases that manifest themselves similarly, namely by abnormal,uncontrolled cell division and growth (Gaspar P. et al. 2022).

Viral screening

Virtual screening (VS) is a computational technique used in drug discovery to

search libraries of small molecules in order to identify those structures which

are most likely to bind to a drug target, typically a protein receptor or enzyme(Rester U. 2008).

Rate of death discovered by viral screening in cancer research

According to the World Health Organization, the yearly number of deaths

caused by cancer worldwide is approximately 10 million (who).

Recent drug discovery efforts have demonstrated that naturally occurring

polyphenolic compounds like delphinidin have potential to inhibit proliferation

and promote apoptosis of breast cancer cells by targeting HER2 receptors

(Patidar K. et al. 2016).

Worldwide, among women between the ages of 15 and 44, cervical cancer

ranks second in terms of frequency and is a leading cause of premature

mortality( Bruni, L., et.al 2022).Between industrialized and developing nations,there is a significant difference in the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer,with less developed areas of the world accounting for 85% of cases and 87% offatalities ( Ferlay - 2015 -). The highest incidence and fatality rates for cervicalcancer are seen in Eastern and Southern Africa within the continent of

Africa( Bruni, L., et.al 2022). The delivery of cervical cancer preventive

programs in SSA is hampered by a number of issues, including inadequate

supplies and equipment for cervical cancer screening and treatment and a lackof diagnosis and treatment initiation due to a lack of service capacity

(Reichheld, A., 2020).

Viral Screening(VS) and Computational methods in Drug

Repurposing

Repurposing a drug consists of two main steps, where the first is based on an invitro screening of approved-drugs for clinical use or that have already been

candidates in clinical trials. After screening, those with the best potential are

validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The second step consists ofan evaluation of the most promising candidate in clinical trials, and thus

highlighting the potential of the drug (Gns,H.S.; Gr, S. 2019).

In terms of in silico approaches, several screening methods have been

developed and applied for drug repurposing, such as machine learning (ML),

molecular docking, network-based, and other virtual approaches.(Orlov,

A.A.;et al 2019).

The utilization of virtual screening greatly optimizes the discovery process, incomparison with experimental strategies. The computational method reduces

the discovery time due to the possibility of performing an initial screening in

large chemical libraries containing millions of compounds \[83]. In this context,compounds databases such as DrugBank, ChemBank, Protein Data Bank, andothers are typically used in this step. (Gns,H.S.; Gr, S.et al 2019).

The databases used in virtual screenings for drug repurposing contain

information related to drug interactions; genes; targets; rare diseases; orphandrugs; clinical trials; pathways and diseases; adverse effects; toxicity profile;

reused drugs; the 3D-molecular structure of drugs. In this context, the

database selection is a critical step for success in the drug repurposing, since

an updated database and a validated screening procedure increase the successrate.(Serçinoğlu, O; et al 2019)

The virtual screening (VS) approach can be applied based on the structure of atarget, or based on the structure of the ligand. Indeed, molecular docking

becomes the most used alternative in structure-based VS (SBVS) in drug

repurposing, so that it has the ability to investigate the potential mechanism ofaction, applying scoring functions to categorize and rank all the compounds .

Besides, molecular dynamics (MD) studies began to be integrated into VS

campaigns to improve screening performance, in order to take into account theflexibility of the target protein (native conformation), improving the evaluationof VS ligands, or even calculate the most accurate binding energy of

them.(Belllera, C.L. et.al 2019).

Conclusion

using prospectively collected data from a national representative cohort of

patients with newly diagnosed cancer, we found that screening for HCV, HBV,and HIV vary widely in terms of costs and cases detected depending on the

tests chosen. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of these

strategies on cancer morbidity and related lifetime costs.
